The underlying idea behind textnets is presented in this paper:

  Christopher A. Bail, "`Combining natural language processing and network
  analysis to examine how advocacy organizations stimulate conversation on social
  media`__," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States
  of America* 113, no. 42 (2016), 11823â€“11828, doi:10.1073/pnas.1607151113.

Features
--------

.. code:: python

    from textnets import TextCorpus, Textnets, cluster_graph


    c = TextCorpus('~/nltk_data/corpora/state_union/*.txt')
    tn = Textnets(c.noun_phrases())
    g_groups = tn.graph(node_type='groups')
    g_words = tn.graph(node_type='words')
    word_clusters = cluster_graph(g_words)

The library builds on the state-of-the-art library `spacy`_ for
natural-language processing and `igraph`_ for network analysis. In addition to
providing a Python library for the analysis of text corpora, textnets can also
be used as a command-line tool to generate network graphs from text corpora.

.. _`spacy`: http://spacy.io/

.. code:: bash

    $ textnets --lex noun_phrases --node-type groups ~/nltk_data/corpora/state_union | gzip > sotu_groups.graphmlz

Run ``textnets --help`` for usage instructions.

Installing
----------

In a `virtual environment`_, run ``python setup.py install`` followed by ``python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm``.
